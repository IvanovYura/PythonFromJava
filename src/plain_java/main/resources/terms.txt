A bad workman always blames his tools
A bad workman always blames his tools
A bird in hand is worth two in the bush
A cat has nine lives
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link
Actions speak louder than words
A drowning man will clutch at a straw
A journey of thousand miles begins with a single step
An empty vessel makes much noise
Barking dogs seldom bite
Better late than never
Better to be poor and healthy rather than rich and sick
Don’t judge a book by its cover
Easy come, easy go
Every man is the architect of his destiny
Every man has his price
Good things come to those who wait
Honesty is the best policy
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst
No gain without pain
Practice makes perfect
Rome wasn’t built in a day
The harder you work, the luckier you get
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
You can’t always get what you want
You can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs
